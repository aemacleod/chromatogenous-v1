			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Allan MacLeod, and this is my learning and project
				website. Over the last two years, I have made a hobby out of learning
				computer science. I have been dabbling to get an understanding of
				the basics in a wide variety of CS subject areas, identify what I
				enjoy doing, and determine what I might want to eventually work on
				professionally. This web page is a stepping stone along that path,
				a place to experiment with the things I am studying, and a way to
				showcase what I have learned.
				<br>
				<br>I am interested in web development, but I have been put off by the
				pace, length of time commitment, and linear nature the course offerings
				I have seen. In creating even a simple website, skills spanning a
				dozen different disciplines are necessary. It’s not practical to
				say, “oh, I’ll learn that next semester and just keep my project
				on hold for now.” It’s difficult to know whether it’s worth investing
				time in learning a skill before you actively need it, and difficult
				to figure out how deeply you need to know a topic once you’ve decided
				it’s useful, e.g. how much knowledge of managing DNS is necessary
				when all you want to do is run a small personal website?
				<br>
				<br>There is also a chicken-and-egg problem in technical job fields:
				I need experience so that I can get a job so that I can get experience,
				but how can I gain experience, for example, in building back-end
				database applications if I don’t have a server or a database to work
				with? I learn most effectively by crawling, walking, running with
				a large dose of exploration, so I have been learning and building
				everything from scratch. It’s a larger up-front time commitment,
				but I find that the network of ideas I build learning in a haphazard
				way is stronger than those I build in a formal learning environment.
				<br>
				<br>Because of the sheer breadth and width of skills necessary to be
				an effective developer, and because my learning path has been so
				scattered, I created this project website as a way of focusing my
				efforts, taking small iterative steps forward, and creating something
				practical to showcase. There are many days when the size of what
				I don’t know is intimidating, and staying motivated is a challenge.
				Small victories are critical, and cataloging accomplishments is a
				helpful way of showing progress concretely.
				<br>

				</ul>
				...and a pastiche of other skills gained through Google searches, Stack
				Overflow queries, forum threads, man pages, and trial and error

			<h2>Projects so far</h2>
			<p>My two major projects so far are a watchface for the Pebble smartwatch,
				called Eight-frame, and this website, Chromatogenous.</p>

			<h3>Eight-frame, a watchface for Pebble smartwatches</h3>
			<p>I designed Eight-frame to show a large variety of information directly
				on the watchface, saving the need to go through menus. The main program
				was written in C, with a JavaScript element that fetches the weather
				as a JSON object, manipulates it, and sends it back to the main program
				as a dictionary. Package management is handled through Node.js, and
				the user menu is made with an npm package and a CSS file containing
				instructions.
				<br>
				<br>Eight-frame was a way of practically applying the programming theory
				I learned, and of creating a project that was personally useful.
				I liked being able to see the wind speed in the morning before deciding
				whether to ride my bike to work, something I would forget to do if
				I had to click, swipe, and tap through a bunch of windows, apps,
				and pages on my phone or computer.
				<br>
				<br> Technically, learning how to set up a development environment, getting
				comfortable with the command line, and getting practical experience
				with debugging were the most important skills I developed here. I
				eventually moved away from using Pebble’s cloud-based editor and
				synced my project with GitHub using the cli tools and git.
				<br>
				<br> In addition to improving the app’s code, I would like to eventually
				write and host the watchface’s configuration page on Chromatogenous
				as a practical exercise in JavaScript and related technologies.
				<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Chromatogenous</h3>
			<p>The name of this website, chromatogenous, is an adjective that means
				‘producing color.’ In this case, I want to add some metaphoric color
				to the literally black-and-white text of a resume, and show off my
				level of competence as I develop it. The website is physically located
				on a Raspberry Pi server. The server is currently running Raspbian
				OS and Apache. As I got used to the command line and SSH, I weaned
				myself off the GUI. In the process of getting the server up, I learned
				a bit about DNS, IP addressing, the basics of running Apache, and
				I got a basic page to display.
				<br>
				<br>When I get to a point in my understanding where the differences between
				distributions begin to matter, I plan to learn Ubuntu and Red Hat
				distributions, too. In the longer term, I want to learn about cloud-based
				platforms like Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. For the near future,
				I will develop this page as a functional exercise in structuring
				HTML documents, using CSS, and writing JavaScript components.</p>
